## Detection – Successful SSH Authentication

### Primary Detection Query
index=main sourcetype=linux_secure "Accepted password"

---

### What this shows
- Successful SSH authentication events generated by `sshd`
- Confirms that valid credentials were used to access the system
- Identifies the user account that was successfully authenticated
- Shows the source IP address used for the login
- Marks the transition from failed attempts to confirmed access

---

### Investigation notes
- User account accessed: `martin_kedob`
- Authentication method: password-based SSH
- Source IP matches the IP observed during previous failed login attempts
- Login occurred shortly after multiple authentication failures

---

### Supporting Query
index=main sourcetype=linux_secure sshd

This query provides full SSH daemon context, including session handling, process IDs, and related authentication events.

---

### Why this matters
- Confirms credential compromise after brute-force or password-guessing activity
- Establishes the exact point where the attacker gained interactive access
- Serves as the pivot event enabling all subsequent post-compromise actions
- Critical milestone in the attack timeline for incident scoping and response
