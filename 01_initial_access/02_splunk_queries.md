## Primary Detection Query

index=main sourcetype=linux_secure "Failed password"

---

## What this shows

- Failed SSH authentication events generated by `sshd`
- Targeted username (`martin_kedob`)
- Source IP address of the authentication attempts
- Destination SSH ports used during the attempts

---

## Why this matters

- Multiple authentication failures within a short time window indicate password-guessing activity
- Identifies the specific account being targeted before a successful compromise
- Confirms malicious behavior even when access has not yet been achieved

---

## Key observations

- All failed attempts targeted the same user account (`martin_kedob`)
- Attempts originated from a single internal IP address
- Multiple destination ports were used, suggesting automated behavior
- This activity directly preceded a successful SSH authentication
